# my-config
Just my collection of configs for my most important programs. I was backing
them up on an external hard drive but I make changes very frequently so the
plugging and un-plugging of the drive was becoming rather tedius. ;)

If you find anything useful here that you want to use then just help yourself.
Some of the documentation might be a little sparse so if you see anything you 
want me to explain then feel free to drop me a line - my email address is on my
profile.

Have fun :-)
