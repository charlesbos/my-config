# my-config
Just my collection of configs for my most important programs. I was backing
them up on an external hard drive but I make changes very frequently so the
plugging and un-plugging of the drive was becoming rather tedius. ;) Note that
any configs that I no longer use but want to keep for reference can be found in
the 'unsynced' directory.

If you find anything useful here that you want to use then just help yourself.
Some of the documentation might be a little sparse so if you see anything you 
want me to explain then feel free to drop me a line - my email address is on my
profile.

Have fun :-)
